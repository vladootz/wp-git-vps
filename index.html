            <p>It is a period of source code turmoil.</p>

            <p>Jedi master Linus Torvalds and many other developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper.</p>

            <p>Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use, but none of the available free systems met his needs.</p>

            <p>Infuriating the emperor, Linus quipped about the name git, which is British English slang meaning "unpleasant person".</p>

            <p>The development of Git began on 3rd April 2005. The project was announced on 6th, and became self-hosting as of 7th April.</p>

            <p>Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21st December 2005, and remains the project's maintainer.</p>

            <p>As of 28th September 2015, GIT's stable version is 2.6 and according to Google Trends it's the most popular version control system in the known universe.</p>
